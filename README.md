# Setup a new Outbound Feeds repo

This is a fusion themes based repository and is intended to be used as the starting point for using _Arc Outboundfeeds_. It doesn't matter if a client is currently using themes or not. This repo will be used to run Outbound feeds in its own dedicated environment.

## Setup

Pre-requisites:

- node / npm installed (node version > 12).
- docker

1. Create a local repo

Clone your Outbound Feeds repo to your local machine. In the arc-partners github account your repo will be named ORG-outboundfeeds, use your Arc organization name in place of ORG. For example, if your organization name is demo, your repo name would be demo-outboundfeeds.

```
git clone git@github.com:arc-partners/ORG-outboundfeeds.git
```

2. Create a read-only personal access token in github

To be able to run locally or deploy outboundfeed bundles you need to create a read-only token in [github](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token). This token needs to be added to your .npmrc file and will allow you to view and install outboundfeeds blocks. The .npmrc file must never be added to the repo or checked in. Please use the following format when setting up your .npmrc:

```
@wpmedia:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com/
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=<your personal access token>
```

3. Install the packages

```
npm install
```

4. Create .env

   Copy env.example to .env and edit the file to replace the placeholders with your correct values.

   - `CONTENT_BASE` - Set your org in `https://api.${ORG}.arcpublishing.com` [ALC](https://redirector.arcpublishing.com/alc/arc-products/pagebuilder/fusion/documentation/recipes/defining-arc-content-source.md#configuring-content_base-and-arc_access_token-for-local-development) This is used by content sources to get data from your prod or sandbox environment. Replace ORG with your org name, like demo or sandbox.demo. This should point to your prod or sandbox environments, not the OBF environments.
   - `ARC_ACCESS_TOKEN` - your readonly developer token. [ALC](https://redirector.arcpublishing.com/alc/arc-products/developer/user-documentation/accessing-the-arc-api/) This is used by content sources to get data from your prod or sandbox environment. This should be from your prod or sandbox environments, not the OBF environments.
   - resizerKey - your orgs resizerKey. If you donâ€™t have it, please contact your Technical Delivery Manager (TDM)
   - `BLOCK_DIST_TAG` - To use production blocks, set this to 'stable', to use development blocks use 'beta'. Fusion defaults to stable if not set.

   The .env file is in .gitignore and should never be checked into github.

5. Update Mock websites

When running the editor locally the list of websites comes from a local file instead of your site service. To have your websites used, you must update the mock file `mocks/siteservice/api/v3/website` with your websites.

```
[
  {
    "_id": "website1",
    "display_name": "Website 1",
    "is_default_website": true
  },
  {
    "_id": "website2",
    "display_name": "Website 2",
    "is_default_website": false
  }
]
```

Run Fusion locally see [here](https://redirector.arcpublishing.com/alc/arc-products/pagebuilder/fusion/documentation/recipes/running-fusion-locally.md) for more details:

```
npx fusion start
```

Once fusion has finished starting you should be able to to get to the pagebuilder editor [pages](http://localhost/pagebuilder/pages) and [templates](http://localhost/pagebuilder/templates) to add and configure feeds locally. Once you have create your templates and resolvers you can use a tool like postman to see them at `http://localhost/arc/outboundfeeds/{FEED_NAME}?outputType=xml&_website={WEBSITE}`

Run tests with:

```
npm test
```

6. Once you are ready to deploy the bundle you will need to setup environment variables in the `environment/org-outboundfeeds.js` and or `environment/org-outboundfeeds-sandbox.js` files. Use the values from your local .env to set the `BLOCK_DIST_TAG` and `resizerKey`. Rename the files, replacing the clients org name with the `org` in the current names. Any values that should not be made public (resizerKey) need to be [encrypted](https://redirector.arcpublishing.com/alc/arc-products/pagebuilder/fusion/documentation/recipes/using-environment-secrets.md).

Once you are ready to [deploy](https://redirector.arcpublishing.com/alc/arc-products/pagebuilder/fusion/documentation/recipes/deploying-feature-pack.md) a bundle, run the npx fusion zip command.

```
npx fusion zip
```

Upload the new bundle that was created in the dist folder using the deployer screen and promote it to Live to run your new bundle.
